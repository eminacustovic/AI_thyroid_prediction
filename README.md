# The ThyroTrack uses AI (artificial intelligence) to generate a schedule of potential activities during healing and represents a solution that, with its characteristics and functionalities, jumps out from the current offer in the world.
# The vision of the ThyroTrack project is to get to know the habits of the end user and eventually become an indispensable value in everyday life. Coordinating operations to monitor people's health status and habits is a multifaceted challenge. This complexity arises from considerations such as dietary patterns, lifestyle habits, and physical activity.
